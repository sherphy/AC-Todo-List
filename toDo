import editTask from "./components/editTask"

edit tasks and project name option

delete project option 
// Delete existing to-do item
function deleteToDo(event) {
  let item = event.target.parentNode;
  toDoItems.removeChild(item);
}

checkbox to automatically delete tasks 
add Back button when submitting form
background-y need to span infinite
localstorage
input forms hover

VERY HACKY WORKAROUND AT editTask, 
i basically set a counter so that when it's even then it will trigger
basically the problem is the submission of task will close the form 
so the showForm(e) will always end in closing the form 
which means that the form doesnt ever open
